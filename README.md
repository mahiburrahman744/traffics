# Traffic Bot

This repository contains a Python script that simulates web traffic to a specified URL using different user agents and referrers. The script leverages Playwright and runs continuously to generate traffic.

## Features

- Uses random user agents to simulate traffic from different devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- Randomly selects referrers from a list of popular websites.
- Simulates scrolling and interactions on the webpage.
- Automatically retries on failure with a backoff mechanism.
